<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Hi! I am Maryam, a first-year PhD student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) (GO SUN DEVILS!). I am part of the TEAL lab, co-advised by [Hasti Seifi](https://hastiseifi.com/) and [Pooyan Fazli](https://pooyanfazli.com/). My research focuses on AI-powered accessibility for blind and low vision users.

Previously, I completed my Master’s in Computer Science from Arizona State under the guidance of [Hasti Seifi](https://hastiseifi.com/), and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Lahore University of Management Sciences [(LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/).
